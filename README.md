# Download Folder File Management Automation Using Python

This simple project offers a solution for organizing your cluttered "Download" folder automatically. The script, named "downloads_file_manager.py", monitors the "Download" folder for any changes and sorts files into respective folders based on their file extensions.

To automate this process, you can utilize the provided batch file named "automate.bat." 

To execute the batch file without showing up the Command Prompt window, a file named "RunScript.vbs" that conatins the batch file can be called. You can automate the running of this program (RunScript.vbs) by creating a basic task on "Windows Task Scheduler" based on your needs.

However, if you're using an operating system other than Windows, you'll need to employ alternative methods to run the Python script.

This project simplifies file management by ensuring that your downloads are neatly organized according to file types, making it easier to locate and access specific files when needed.

Note: It's essential to adjust the paths within each file to match your system configuration. Also modify the batch file accordingly.
